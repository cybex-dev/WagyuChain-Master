Wagyu Project: Storing Cow information on the blockchain

Status: Incomplete (in development)

What is incomplete:
 - Ether payments
 - GUI (linking of contract variables e.g cows stored on blockchain provided as dropdown/auto-complete suggestions to UI)

What is working/complete:
 - Contract
 - UI and accessing/interacting with contract functions e.g. Adding Cow to Blockchain
 - Events of blockchain

How to Interact:
 Note: Ganache is solely used for contract/UI
 1. Ensure blockchain is deployed to Ganache RPC. Use index.html for this
 2. Access blockchain functions (start by adding cow to blockchain via Farmer.html (use menu on navbar provided)
 3. You will see an event posted (using Bootstrap 'alert-success')
